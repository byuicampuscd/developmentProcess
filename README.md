            --- To: Developers --- <br>
            This contract will lay out everything specifically about the product. This should define the programming language(s) to be used, the design of the product (using any necessary diagrams), any third party APIs, the use cases that are to be tested, and the features that will be implemented in the product. <br>
            This link provides a template of a Software Design Document (SDD) that provides useful information on what is to be written for the Contract: http://goo.gl/qtzv5p <br>

            <h6>Tests</h6>
            --- To: Developers --- <br>
            The tests should be programs that will test the system to verify and validate the requirements. <br>
            This tutorial provides information on different testing methods and when and why then should be used. Use this to develop tests for each product: http://goo.gl/fbhr8N
